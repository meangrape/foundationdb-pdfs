FoundationDB PDFs
=================

This is the content of the [FoundationDB GitHub
wiki](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/wiki/Documentation-Blitz-Homepage) converted to PDFs. The intent is to provide the ability easily
annotatible documents and support a better reading experience on devices other than web browsers. (I did this because I wanted to read them on my remarkable.)
This is a naive conversion with `pandoc` so there are probably small problems here or there.



FoundationDB
============

FoundationDB is a distributed database designed to handle large volumes of structured data across clusters of commodity servers. It organizes data as an ordered key-value store and employs ACID transactions for all operations. It is especially well-suited for read/write workloads but also has excellent performance for write-intensive workloads. Users interact with the database using API language binding.
